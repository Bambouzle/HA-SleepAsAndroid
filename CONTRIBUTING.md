# Contributing to this repository

## Feel free to open issues

Issues will help us to make this integration better!

## Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

## Make your update

While making changes and commits keep in mind that:
* this repository is using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) and you must follow the specification
* commits should be atomic and do just one thing. Don't try to fit all changes in single commit.  
* every commit should turn project from working to working state
* in commits body tell us about changes motivation, not how it work 
* we are keeping strait forward main branch and your commits will not be squashed while merging PR (except very large changes)
* we are using CI tools for making releases and generating release description based on commit headers

## Open a pull request 

When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review,  open your PR (pull request).

The PR header should use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) in very general way (for example: while adding new feature you have to fix some hidden issue, then PR should be "feat" and contain two commits: "fix" and "feat")

The PR body should contain description of your motivation, tell us about fixing issues, new amazing features, describe logic and so on. 
 
## Submit your PR & get it reviewed

 * Once you submit your PR, others from the community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a self review.
 * After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
 
## Your PR is merged!

Congratulations! The whole community thanks you.
